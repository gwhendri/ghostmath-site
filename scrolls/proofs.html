      <h2>Proof 1: Irrationality of √n for Non-Square Integers</h2>
      <p>We prove that for any natural number n that is not a perfect square, the square root of n is irrational.</p>
      <p>Suppose √n = a/b in lowest terms, where a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0, and gcd(a, b) = 1.</p>
      <p>Then n = a²/b² ⇒ nb² = a². This means a² is divisible by n.</p>
      <p>But this leads to a contradiction unless n is a perfect square — because otherwise, a would have a prime factor that b doesn’t, contradicting their minimality.</p>
      <p>Thus, √n is irrational if n is not a perfect square. ■</p>

      <h2>Proof 2: Superexponential Collapse</h2>
      <p>Claim: limₙ→∞ [nⁿ / (1 + 1/n)ⁿⁿ] = 0</p>
      <p>This result captures the intuition that exponentiating a base slightly greater than 1 by a massive power like nⁿ will dominate nⁿ itself in the denominator.</p>

      <p>We can intuitively rewrite the denominator:</p>
      <p>(1 + 1/n)ⁿⁿ ≈ eⁿⁿ⁻¹(1 + o(1))</p>
      <p>And since the numerator grows like nⁿ, we are left with:</p>
      <p>nⁿ / eⁿⁿ⁻¹ → 0</p>
      <p>This collapse is more powerful than exponential decay — it's superexponential.</p>
