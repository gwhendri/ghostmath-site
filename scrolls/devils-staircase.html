    <h1>Why Riemann Fails on the Devil’s Staircase</h1>

      <p>Riemann tries to win the refinement race by slicing the x-axis finer and finer, hoping to approximate the area under a function through partitions and step sums. This works well for normal functions — but not for the Devil’s Staircase.</p>

      <p>The Devil’s Staircase (Cantor function) is flat on most of the interval \([0,1]\), but it “rises” only on the uncountable Cantor set — a set with measure zero.</p>

      <p><strong>Riemann integration fails because:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upper sums overestimate due to the ghostly rises on the Cantor set</li>
        <li>Lower sums underestimate due to the long flat segments</li>
        <li>The two never converge → You can’t integrate it with Riemann</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because Riemann partitions are countable — but the Cantor set is uncountable. That means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple jumps can occur <em>inside a single partition element</em></li>
        <li>The uncountable structure slips between the cracks</li>
        <li>The Riemann sums cannot “see” all the rises — they miss the soul of the function</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Riemann gets beat because he tries to refine through measure-zero fog. It’s like trying to measure vapor using building blocks.</p>

      <h2>Now Enter Lebesgue</h2>

      <p>Lebesgue doesn’t slice the domain — he slices the range. He says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        At each y-value, how much of the domain maps to it?
      </blockquote>

      <p>Using sigma-algebras like the Borel sets, Lebesgue can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure the thickness of level sets</li>
        <li>Reach down deep into irrational, non-interval structures</li>
        <li>Assign measure even to weird, uncountable sets like the Cantor set</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That’s what makes the Devil’s Staircase Lebesgue-integrable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s measurable at every level</li>
        <li>The integration happens vertically, not horizontally</li>
        <li>It sees through the fractal chaos</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Symmetry Key</h2>
      <p>The Devil’s Staircase satisfies:</p>
      <pre><code>f(x) + f(1 - x) = 1</code></pre>
      <p>So for every little ghost rise on the left, there’s a mirrored flattening on the right. The whole function balances perfectly across the interval.</p>

      <p>That’s why the Lebesgue integral from 0 to 1 is exactly:</p>
      <pre><code>\(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\)</code></pre>
