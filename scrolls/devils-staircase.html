  <h1>Why Riemann Fails and Lebesgue Wins on the Devil’s Staircase</h1>

  <p>Riemann tries to win the refinement race by slicing the x-axis finer and finer, hoping to approximate the area under a function through partitions and step sums. This works well for normal functions—but not for the Devil’s Staircase.</p>

  <p>The Devil’s Staircase (Cantor function) is flat on most of the interval <code>[0,1]</code>, but it “rises” only on the uncountable Cantor set—a set with measure zero.</p>

  <h2>Why Riemann Fails</h2>

  <p>Riemann integration fails because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Riemann has countable partitions, but the Devil's Staircase is constructed from the Cantor set, which is uncountable.</li>
    <li>This means some Riemann partitions will contain more than one jump, causing the upper and lower sums to never match.</li>
    <li>So the integral doesn’t converge using Riemann’s method.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    You can’t integrate it with Riemann — he’s trying to refine through measure-zero fog. It’s like trying to measure vapor using building blocks.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Now Enter Lebesgue</h2>

  <p>Lebesgue doesn’t slice the domain — he slices the range. He asks:</p>
  <blockquote>“At each y-value, how much of the domain maps to it?”</blockquote>

  <p>Using sigma-algebras like the Borel sets, Lebesgue can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure the thickness of level sets</li>
    <li>Reach into irrational, non-interval structures</li>
    <li>Assign measure even to weird, uncountable sets like the Cantor set</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That’s what makes the Devil’s Staircase Lebesgue-integrable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s measurable at every level</li>
    <li>The integration happens vertically, not horizontally</li>
    <li>It sees through the fractal chaos</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Real Kicker: Symmetry</h2>

  <p>The Devil’s Staircase satisfies:</p>
  <blockquote><code>f(x) + f(1−x) = 1</code></blockquote>

  <p>So for every little ghost rise on the left, there’s a mirrored flattening on the right. The whole function balances perfectly across the interval.</p>

  <p><strong>→ That’s why the Lebesgue integral from 0 to 1 is exactly <code>1/2</code></strong></p>
